# Elytra Bounce / Elytra Hopping
Same mod, just I just modified the file "fabric.mod.json" to say to Fabric that this mod is compatible with any version of Minecraft  
Please reward the original author of the original mod for making the code  
The original mod is on [GitHub](https://github.com/dzwdz/elytra_bounce) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elytra-hopping)
